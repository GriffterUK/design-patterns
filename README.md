# Design patterns
Examples of design patterns as referenced mainly from the infamous GoF book Design Patterns

This repository demonstrates the formation and use of object-oriented design patterns as described in the book:

> Design patterns : elements of reusable object-oriented software Hardcover â€“ 31 Oct 1994
> by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm ,Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides (a.k.a Gang of Four)

Whilst the book is over 20 years old, some of the patterns are still relevant (although many more patterns are also used today).

The book describes 27 patterns, divided into 3 categories:

## Creational
For creating objects

## Structural
For object composition

## Behavioural
For dynamically changing object behaviour
